This code includes the use of the CC2420ActiveMessageC module to give us control of the power level in our main
XYZC.nc and XYZAppC.nc files wherein we can change it dynamically in the code. The alternative (what we did initially)
is to fix a particular power level in the Makefile while burning the code onto the mote.
